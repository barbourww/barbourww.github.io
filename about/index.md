# Biography

I am a doctoral student in Civil Engineering at Vanderbilt University researching transportation systems with [Professor Daniel Work](https://my.vanderbilt.edu/danwork/). I earned my M.S. degree in Civil Engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and B.S. in Biosystems Engineering from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, where I graduated summa cum laude with distinction from the Chancellorâ€™s Honors Program and the Haslam Scholars Program. I has previous work experience from Oak Ridge National Laboratory and CSX Transportation. I have also received graduate funding support from the Roadway Safety Institute and Federal Highway Administration.

My career and research interests focus on the application of novel and advanced computational techniques to transportation systems engineering; examples include big data analytics, machine learning, optimization, and artificial intelligence. I have applied these interests in the freight rail transportation domain through ongoing industry collaboration with Class I railroads, where improvements in network operations can lead to capacity and efficiency gains for the system. My other domain interests include pedestrian and cyclist accessibility, public transit planning, and transportation policy.

In my free time I enjoy woodworking, building electronics, backpacking, biking, and beer tasting. See my [blog posts]({{ site.url }}/chronposts/) for some of my personal projects. I have a hound-mix puppy who goes by Mikey; coincidentally, he also enjoys hiking and biking with me.
