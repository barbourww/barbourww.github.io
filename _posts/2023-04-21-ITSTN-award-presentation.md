I-24 MOTION was honored with the Project of Significance Award from ITS Tennessee at their annual meeting in Memphis. I accepted the award along with the other project partners and presented on it to the conference. I-24 MOTION fits into the I-24 Smart Corridor (a project in which I am also involved) and will help optimize the integrated corridor management function of the roadway.
