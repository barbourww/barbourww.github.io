Will Barbour and Lee Smith (TDOT) presented during a connected and automated vehicles webinar hosted by The Eastern Transportation Coalition. They discussed the I-24 MOTION testbed and its implications for CAV and human driver trajectory data. Terabytes worth of anonymized trajectory data will start being produced by the testbed, which can then be used by state DOT's, universities, and industry for CAV and other transportation studies. Watch their presentation below or [on YouTube](https://youtu.be/OJYdYJKcouc?t=2043).
